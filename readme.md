# Wally

Flash your [ZSA Keyboard](https://zsa.io) the EZ way.

This repository hosts the code and releases for Windows users. It replaces the original
[Wally repo](https://github.com/zsa/wally).

## Getting started.
Head to the [release page](https://github.com/zsa/wally-win/releases) to download the latest installer. Note you will need administrator privileges to install Wally.

⚠️ When running the installer, make sure the User Account Control popup includes the following line:

**Verified publisher: ZSA Technology Labs Inc.**

## Contributing
If you wish to add a distribution channel for Wally, please create a pull request including documentation and the files / scripts required.

The following instructions apply only to those who wish to actively _develop_ Wally and contribute new features or bugfixes to this open-source project. If you simply want to flash your board with some fresh firmware, see above.

Wally is built using [C# and the WPF Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/getting-started/walkthrough-my-first-wpf-desktop-application?view=netframeworkdesktop-4.8). It follows the [MVVM pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2009/february/patterns-wpf-apps-with-the-model-view-viewmodel-design-pattern).
